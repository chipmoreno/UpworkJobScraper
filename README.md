Job Application Assistant
A Flask web application that scrapes job listings and provides tools for analysis, visualization, and making application decisions. This project serves as a personal assistant for job seekers, particularly for those looking for online freelance work.

Key Features ðŸ¤–
Job Scraping: Scrapes job data from a specified online platform (e.g., Upwork) based on predefined keywords.

Data Analysis: Provides a dashboard with descriptive statistics on job budgets, experience levels, and elapsed times.

Visualization: Renders basic visualizations of job data to help users identify trends.

Machine Learning Integration: Includes a simple machine learning model to predict which jobs are a good fit and which to skip.

Data Persistence: Saves and loads a list of "seen" jobs to avoid processing the same listings multiple times.

Debugging & Development Tools: Includes a debug mode with default data, and a basic authentication system for protected routes.
